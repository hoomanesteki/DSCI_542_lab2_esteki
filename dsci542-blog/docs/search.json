    "text": "The Problem: Data is Everywhere, but Insight is Not\nEvery day organizations generate huge amounts of data such as sales records, customer behavior, marketing metrics, and operational logs. However, it is still difficult for most decision-makers to do their own data explorations. Even for the simplest of queries like “What changed last month?” they depend almost entirely on analysts.\nThis reliance on analysts delays the decision-making process and prevents organizations from fully utilizing their data resources. The problem is not that data is hard to come by, it is that it is hard to access."
